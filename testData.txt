Favorite images from #StarWars #EpisodeIX “The Rise of Skywalker” Teaser Trailer Part 2
Also seeing Carrie & Billy Dee Williams gave me goosebumps, as did @HamillHimself narration... this series means the world to me and just being able to live in a world where there’s so much #StarWars makes my heart happy. 
December can’t come soon enough!
Star Wars Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker. dunno how I feel about that title, but the teaser looks SO GOOD! Literally so much to unpack! Kylo wrecking that resistance fighter, Rey taking on a TIE, EMPEROR LAUGH?! #EpisodeIX #RiseOfSkywalker
I love JJ Abrams, but it’s certainly going to be interesting to see how he attempts to close the Skywalker Saga. The man is literally known for cliffhangers, plot twists, and loose ends in his stories... #StarWarsCelebaration #EpisodeIX
Update: in waiting for the stream to start, hearing the score from Return of the Jedi still gives me chills, even without the visuals. #StarWarsCelebaration #EpisodeIX
It just hit me that in about an hour and a half the Episode IX teaser trailer will be out... I don’t think my body is ready for this. #StarWarsCelebaration #EpisodeIX
I’m also changing my rating of Stay from a 9, to an 8.5... next up, Fracture.
Right so this is an emotional powerhouse of a film with amazing performances all across the board. Anthony Mackie is so deserving of a rise in stardom, consistently doing great work & Gosling delivers his best performance so far in this marathon. 
With this, The Little Mermaid, and the inevitable film adaptation of Hamilton, there’s a lot to lol forward to with him.
As someone who knows next to nothing about In The Heights (any info I know is from @yayeeeeh), I do have to say I’m very excited about this movie. Lin’s been doing nothing but incredible work from Hamilton, Moana, Mary Poppins Returns, and Curb Your Enthusiasm. #InTheHeights
That was legitimately an ALL TIME #WrestleMania moment. So genuine. So heartfelt. Perfectly crafted throughout. Phenomenal payoff to Kofi Kingston’s eleven year tenure that I never thought I’d see. Celebration was as good as the match itself.
So, if you’re reading this and need a sign of encouragement; GO SEE #Shazam ASAP!!
Rest of the cast was also great and it was wonderful to see Mark Strong get another shot at being a super villain after he was arguably the best part of the 2011 Green Lantern movie.
@ZacharyLevi as Shazam is one of the best superhero castings to date. He captured the spirit of a child living in an adult’s body perfectly and really helped elevate the movie as a whole.
#SHAZAM was an absolute blast of a movie! Easily one of the most fun experiences I’ve had watching a comic book movie, while also genuinely being a great film. 
Even if you are just slightly interested, I highly recommend you going to YouTube and watching this episode (streaming free) to get yourself hooked.
